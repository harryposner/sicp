# Exercise 2.22

The first method gives a reversed list because it naively cdrs down the input
list and conses up the output list.  Each step takes the head of the old list
and puts it at the head of the new list, so once you've cdred down to the end
of the old list, you've put the last element of the old list at the head of the
new list.

The second method doesn't work because cons doesn't append to a list; it only
prepends.
