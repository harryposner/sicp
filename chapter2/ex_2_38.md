The result of `(fold-left f initial '(x1 x2 ... xn))` is:
```
(f ... (f (f initial x1) x2) ... xn)
```

The result of `(fold-right f initial '(x1 x2 ... xn))` is:
```
(f x1 (f x2 ... (f xn initial)))
```

For `fold-left` and `fold-right` to return the same results, `f` must be:
* commutative, because `fold-left` and `fold-right` call `f` with the
  accumulator and the list element in opposite positions, and
* associative, because `fold-left` and `fold-right` accumulate from opposite
  ends of the list.

By way of example, consider the following:
```
(fold-left + 0 '(1 2 3 4))
=> (+ (+ (+ (+ 0 1) 2) 3) 4)

(fold-right + 0 '(1 2 3 4))
=> (+ 1 (+ 2 (+ 3 (+ 4 0))))
```

Or in infix notation:
```
Fold left : (((0 + 1) + 2) + 3) + 4
Fold right: (1 + (2 + (3 + (4 + 0))))
```
