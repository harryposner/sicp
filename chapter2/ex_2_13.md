# Exercise 2.13

With two positive intervals, the lower bound of the product is the product of
the lower bounds of the factors, and the upper bound of the product is the
product of the upper bounds of the factors.  Let the two intervals have centers
Cx and Cy and absolute widths (not percent widths) Wx and Wy.

The lower bound is:

    (Cx - Wx)(Cy - Wy) = CxCy - CxWy - CyWx + WxWy

The upper bound is:

    (Cx + Wx)(Cy + Wy) = CxCy + CxWy + CyWx + WxWy

The center is the midpoint between the two bounds:

    (CxCy - CxWy - CyWx + WxWy + CxCy + CxWy + CyWx + WxWy) / 2
      = CxCy + WxWy

The percent tolerance is both (UB/Ctr - 1) and (1 - LB/Ctr).

    (UB/Ctr - 1) = (CxCy + CxWy +CyWx + WxWy) / (CxCy + WxWy) - 1
    (1 - LB/Ctr) = 1 - (CxCy - CxWy - CyWx + WxWy) / (CxCy + WxWy)

In terms of percent tolerances Px = Wx/Cx and Py = Wy/Cy:

    (UB/Ctr - 1) = (CxCy + CxCyPy + CxCyPx + CxCyPxPy) / (CxCy + CxCyPxPy) - 1
                 = (1 + Py + Px + PxPy) / (1 + PxPy) - 1
                 = (1 + Py + Px + PxPy - (1 + PxPy)) / (1 + PxPy)
                 = (Py + Px) / (1 + PxPy)
    (1 - LB/Ctr) = 1 - (CxCy - CxCyPy - CxCyPx + CxCyPxPy) / (CxCy + CxCyPxPy)
                 = 1 - (1 - Py - Px + PxPy) / (1 + PxPy)
                 = (1 + PxPy - (1 - Py - Px + PxPy)) / (1 + PxPy)
                 = (Py + Px) / (1 + PxPy)

Approximation given small deviations screams for a Taylor expansion.  The
problem says "simple," so we'll do a first-order expansion.  It makes sense to
center the approximation around (0, 0) since Px and Py are near zero by
construction.  Let G(Px, Py) be the percentage deviation of the product
interval.  Take the partial derivatives:

    dG/dPx = (1 + PxPy) - Py(Py + Px)
           = 1 + PxPy - Py^2 + PxPy
           = 2PxPy + 1 - Py^2
    dG/dPy = 2PxPy + 1 - Px^2

The Taylor approximation T is:

    T(Px, Py) = G(0, 0) + dG/dPx(0, 0)Px + dG/dPy(0, 0)Py
              = Px + Py
