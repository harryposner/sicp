# Exercise 1.19

T is a linear transformation of the vector `[a, b]'` and can be represented as
the following matrix:
```
[[p+q, q],
 [q  , p]]
``` 

Square the matrix and find that:

```
p-prime = p^2 + p^2
        = (double (square p))
q-prime = q^2 + 2pq
        = (+ (square q) (* 2 p q))
```
Insert the above into the relevant parts of the provided code.
