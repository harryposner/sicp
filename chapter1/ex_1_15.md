# Exercise 1.15

1. `p` is applied 5 times, since the smallest integer `n` that solve `12.15 *
   (1/3)^n = 0.1` is `n = 5`.

2. The space and steps are proportional to `log(a)`.  The number of steps we
   need is `n = ceil((log(a) - log(0.1)) / log(3))`.  Since it's a recursive
   process, it stores the number of steps remaining as deferred applications,
   so space grows in the same order as the number of steps.
