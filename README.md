These are my solutions to exercises in *The Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs*.  A few notes:

- I did all the work at the REPL, so some exercises may depend on state built
  up in previous exercises, e.g. functions defined earlier.  Running individual
  files may not work.

- At some point, I switched from MIT Scheme to Racket SICP mode.  Everything
  should work fine in both, though.
